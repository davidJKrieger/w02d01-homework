// #### Refresher

// So far we have seen:

//     * Strings
//     * Numbers
//     * Booleans
//     * Arrays
//     * Objects

// When these datatypes are combined, we get a ** data structure **, for example, an array that contains objects that each contain booleans.

// Suppose you are tasked with creating some software, and it is up to ** you ** to determine which datatypes and what data structure to use.For each of the following, write which ** data types ** you would use to represent the data, and then give a small example of the ** data structure **:

//* A light switch that can be either on or off.
    // booleans
//* A user's email address.
    // strings
//* A spaceship with a hull, laser blasters, tractor beam, and warp drive.
    // object
//* A list of student names from our class.
    // array
//* A list of student names from our class, each with a location.
    // object
//* A list of student names from our class, each with a location and each with a list of favorite tv shows.
    // object
